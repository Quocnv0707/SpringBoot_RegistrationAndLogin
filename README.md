Spring Boot Registration and Login with MySQL Database Tutorial

Through this Spring Boot tutorial, I’d love to guide you to develop a Java web application from scratch with the essential features: user registration, login, logout and view users list – with user information stored in MySQL database. You will go through the process of coding a Spring Boot project using the following technologies:

- Spring Web MVC for the web layer
- Spring Data JPA with Hibernate framework or the data access layer
- Spring Security for authentication, login and logout
- Thymeleaf as template engine
- HTML 5 and Bootstrap 4 for responsive user interface
- JUnit 5 and AssertJ for unit testing
- MySQL database

And to follow this tutorial, make sure that you have these software programs installed on your computer:
Java Development Kit (JDK)
Intellij
MySQL Community server and MySQL Workbench

You can use the latest versions of these software programs
